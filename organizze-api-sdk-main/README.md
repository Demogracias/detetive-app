# Organizze API SDK

Auto-generated client libraries for the [Organizze](https://organizze.com.br) API, simplifying integration with your personal finance data.

This repository provides type-safe, well-documented client libraries in multiple languages, based on the [official Organizze API documentation](https://github.com/organizze/api-doc). These SDKs handle authentication, request formatting, and response parsing, allowing you to focus on building your application.

## Important Notice

> **Note:** While the [official Organizze API documentation](https://github.com/organizze/api-doc) describes the available endpoints, some specifications in this repository's [`specs/openapi.yaml`](./specs/openapi.yaml) may not align perfectly with the official documentation. This is because the official documentation can become outdated over time.
>
> The OpenAPI specification in this repository has been refined based on real-world API testing and may include corrections, additional constraints, or updated field definitions that better reflect the actual API behavior. When in doubt, the OpenAPI specification in this repository should be considered more accurate for implementation purposes.

  date: "2025-12-12",
  amount_cents: -5000,
  category_id: 123,
  account_id: 456,
});
```

### Python

#### Installation

```bash
# From PyPI (recommended)
pip install organizze_api

# Or from source
cd clients/python
pip install -e .

# Or directly from git
pip install git+https://github.com/BarretoTech/organizze-api-sdk.git#subdirectory=clients/python
```

#### Usage

```python
import organizze_api
from organizze_api.rest import ApiException

# Configure authentication
configuration = organizze_api.Configuration(
    host="https://api.organizze.com.br/rest/v2",
    username="your.email@example.com",
    password="your_api_token"
)

# Set required User-Agent header
configuration.api_key['userAgent'] = 'MyApp (your.email@example.com)'

# Use the API
with organizze_api.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # List bank accounts
    bank_accounts_api = organizze_api.BankAccountsApi(api_client)
    accounts = bank_accounts_api.list_bank_accounts()

    # Create a transaction
    transactions_api = organizze_api.TransactionsApi(api_client)
    transaction = organizze_api.Transaction(
        description="Groceries",
        date="2025-12-12",
        amount_cents=-5000,
        category_id=123,
        account_id=456
    )
    result = transactions_api.create_transaction(transaction)

    # Get current month budgets
    budgets_api = organizze_api.BudgetsApi(api_client)
    budgets = budgets_api.list_current_month_budgets()
```

## API Authentication

All Organizze API requests require:

1. **HTTP Basic Auth**

   - Username: Your Organizze account email
   - Password: API token from [https://app.organizze.com.br/configuracoes/api-keys](https://app.organizze.com.br/configuracoes/api-keys)

2. **User-Agent Header** (Required)
   - Format: `ApplicationName (email@example.com)`
   - Omitting this header returns `400 Bad Request`

## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) for toolchain management and [moon](https://moonrepo.dev) for task running.

1. **Install proto**

   Follow the installation instructions at [https://moonrepo.dev/proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto)

2. **Install the toolchain**

   The project's toolchain is defined in [`.prototools`](./.prototools). Install all required tools by running:

   ```bash
   proto use
   ```

   This will install:

   - moon
   - Node.js
   - Python
   - npm
   - uv

### Regenerating Clients

This project uses [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) to automatically generate clients from the OpenAPI specification located at [`specs/openapi.yaml`](./specs/openapi.yaml).

#### Generate All Clients (Recommended)

```bash
moon run :generate-client
```

### Updating the OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI specification is the single source of truth for all generated clients. To update it:

1. Edit [`specs/openapi.yaml`](./specs/openapi.yaml) with your changes
2. Regenerate the clients using the commands above
3. Test the generated clients thoroughly
4. Update the package versions in client-specific files (if needed)
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you've found an endpoint that's not properly documented, discovered a bug, or want to add support for a new language, we'd love your help.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Update the OpenAPI specification** in [`specs/openapi.yaml`](./specs/openapi.yaml)
   - Add missing endpoints
   - Fix incorrect types or constraints
   - Improve descriptions
3. **Regenerate the clients** using the commands in the Development section
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly with real API calls
5. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - A clear description of what you changed and why
   - Examples of the issue you're fixing (if applicable)
   - Test results showing the changes work as expected

### Found an Issue?

If you encounter discrepancies between the SDK and the actual API behavior, please [open an issue](https://github.com/BarretoTech/organizze-api-sdk/issues) with details about the expected vs. actual behavior.
